# Listings Demo
Listings Demo

### The problem

The goal is to create a mobile app for fetching and displaying a list of listings with the option for showing more details by selecting a specific listing from the main list.

### The solution
- **SwiftUI**
- **Combine**
- **MVVM**: as it works good with SwiftUI & Data Binding (using Combine built-in features in SwiftUI)
- **Dependency Inversion Principle & Dependency Injection Techniques**: for loose coupling and making components more isloated, testable, and easy to change at any point
- **Network Layer**: to make it easier for reusability and testability as app grows
- **SOLID**

#### Unit Tests
- Covering home view model for now
- Using Mocks to help isolate and test small units of code and to simultate difficult scenarios like network conditions

### TODO
- [ ] App Icon
- [ ] More Unit Tests
- [ ] UI Tests
- [ ] Enhance UI
